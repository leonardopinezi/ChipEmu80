# ChipEmu80

ðŸŽ‰ **Welcome to ChipEmu80!** ðŸŽ‰

ChipEmu80 is a project dedicated to emulating classic 8-bit CPUs, inspired by the Z80, allowing you to run and test Assembly programs directly on your computer.  

---

## About the Project

The goal of ChipEmu80 is to provide:

- A **lightweight emulator** for 8-bit Assembly programs.  
- **Complete documentation** of available opcodes.  
- Simple examples for testing and learning Assembly programming.  

This project is ideal for retrocomputing enthusiasts, students, and anyone interested in exploring low-level programming.

## Repository Structure

The repository has two main branches:

1. **main** â€“ Contains this site, the welcome README, and general information.  
2. **Emulator** â€“ Contains the emulator itself and detailed documentation of opcodes and usage examples.  

To access the emulator and full documentation:  
[âž¡ Go to the Emulator branch](https://github.com/leonardopinezi/ChipEmu80/MANUAL.md)
